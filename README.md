Physics Informed Deep Learning: Data-driven Solutions and Discovery of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations 
The aim of this work is to introduce physics informed - an approach for solving forward and inverse problems by applying deep learning techniques to any given law of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. As a result of our developments, we are able to solve two main classes of problems: data-driven solutions and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Different algorithms are devised depending on the type and arrangement of available data, namely continuous time and discrete time algorithms. This novel class of data-efficient universal function approximators encodes any underlying physical laws naturally as prior information. We demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and infer physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters. Data-driven discovery of partial differential equations is the focus of the second part.
